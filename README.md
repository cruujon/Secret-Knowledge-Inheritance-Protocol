# Project Description

## Problem / Motivation

Currently, those who want to pass down their knowledge or skills have no choice but to share secret information directly — either orally or on paper.  
There is no verifiable way to record _who passed it to whom_, which makes extinction of such knowledge a real risk.

Traditional craftsmanship is disappearing globally not only because knowledge is lost, but because the act of transmission is invisible to institutions and future generations.  
Anchoring these successions on-chain — with auditable records and public funding mechanisms — makes cultural inheritance _visible_ and _preservable_.

Additional risks:

- Even though such cultural assets are meaningful and important to preserve, it is often unclear who contributed to their preservation.
- Historically sensitive knowledge is vulnerable to censorship by institutions or governments. Oral traditions can be altered, sanitized, or erased.

## Solution

- Record _who (wallet)_ passed knowledge to _whom (wallet)_ on-chain, preserving lineage and provenance.
- Encrypt content **client-side** so the knowledge itself remains private.
- Store encrypted data on IPFS; only its hash (CID) is referenced on-chain.
- Only the designated successor's wallet can derive the correct key to decrypt the content.
- This enables preservation of private cultural assets without forcing public disclosure.

## Target Users

- Individuals wanting to pass down secret or valuable knowledge _privately_.
- Examples:
  - A restaurant owner with a secret recipe but no successor.
  - Craftsmen with unique techniques that cannot be publicized.
  - Oral storytelling traditions and local cultural narratives.

# Key Features

- **Client-side encrypted inheritance**

  - The owner selects a PDF and a successor wallet address.
  - File is encrypted entirely in the browser using **AES-256-GCM**.
  - The AES key is derived from the successor’s Ethereum address via **PBKDF2 (100,000 iterations)**.

- **Successor-only decryption**

  - Only the wallet that matches the successor address can regenerate the AES key.

- **IPFS-based decentralized storage**

  - Only encrypted blobs are uploaded.
  - Blob format: `[IV (12 bytes)][Encrypted Data]`.

- **On-chain lineage**

  - Immutable record of: owner → successor, `ipfsHash`, `fileName`, `fileSize`, `timestamp`, and status flags.
  - Creates verifiable historical context for each inheritance.

- **End-to-end flow**
  - Originator: encrypt → upload → register on-chain
  - Successor: verify → fetch → decrypt → download

# Architecture Overview

## System Components

- **Frontend (Next.js + Wagmi + viem)**  
  Handles:

  - file encryption/decryption (Web Crypto API)
  - IPFS upload/download (via API route or direct)
  - contract calls
  - lineage display

- **Blockchain (Arbitrum Sepolia / Solidity)**  
  Responsible for:

  - storing inheritance metadata
  - verifying successor identity (`msg.sender`)
  - preserving lineage

- **Storage: IPFS**
  - Stores encrypted blobs only.
  - Contract stores the `ipfsHash` as reference.

# Core User Flow

## 1. Creating an Inheritance (Originator)

<img width="814" height="780" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37d357ec-621d-46ea-9807-c7f92191c971" />

**1-0. Connect Wallet**  
Connect your wallet to the app.  
Non-crypto users can also generate a wallet easily using just an email address.

**1-1. Prepare the Knowledge Asset**  
The originator prepares the secret or culturally valuable information they wish to pass down — such as a recipe, a craft technique, or any sensitive document — in **PDF format**.

**1-2. Set the Successor Wallet in the "Inherit" tab**  
At the **Successor Wallet** field in the Inherit section tab, enter the wallet address of the person who will inherit the information.

**1-3. Upload the PDF**  
Click **Upload PDF** and select the file you want to inherit.

**1-4. Choose a Tag Type**  
Select a relevant tag such as _Recipe_, _Cultural Heritage_, _Finance_, etc.  
(These tags allow efficient querying and classification in the database.)

**1-5. Create Inheritance**  
Click **Create Inheritance**.  
Your wallet will request a signature. Once signed, the file is **encrypted client-side** and safely uploaded to **IPFS**.

**1-6. Access via Vaults**  
Uploaded inheritance entries can always be accessed and searched under the **Vaults** tab.

---

## 2. Receiving an Inheritance (Successor)

<img width="1063" height="894" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8daa2466-e67e-41a6-a616-7ccb6ad166ad" />

**2-0. Connect Wallet**  
The chosen successor connects using the **same wallet address** registered by the originator.

**2-1. View Received Metadata in the "Received / Vaults" tab**  
Once connected, the successor can open the **Received / Vaults** section to view metadata for all inheritance entries sent to them.

**2-2. Download & Decrypt**  
Click **Download (DL)**.  
The encrypted file is fetched and automatically decrypted locally, then saved safely to the successor’s device.

---

## 3. Verifying and Evaluating Inheritances in Graph View in the "Dashboard" tab

<img width="869" height="819" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36022cca-c05a-4920-8a24-52a8b5cc2220" />

**3-1. Visual Lineage Graph**  
All contributors in an inheritance chain — originators, successors, and cultural organizations curating heritage — can visually review each succession event.  
The dashboard presents a **graph of parent–child inheritance relationships**, showing how knowledge has been passed across generations.

Additional insights include:

- Automatic counting of total contributors in each inheritance chain
- Easy identification of branching cultural lineages
- High-level visibility into how cultural assets evolve

Example external stakeholders who may access the graph view:  
_Local governments, museums, cultural preservation NGOs, public goods organizations_

**3-2. Evidence for Public Goods Funding and Access Control**  
External organizations can use the verifiable on-chain proof of inheritance to:

- Evaluate cultural preservation contributions
- Use inheritance lineage as **evidence** in public-goods or grant-funding processes
- Apply **gating criteria** (e.g., only contributors of a specific inheritance chain can access a program, benefit, or grant)

This ensures that historical knowledge is preserved with integrity and that contributors receive recognition and opportunities aligned with their cultural work.

# Encryption & Decryption Flow (MVP)

## 1. Owner (Originator)

1. Select PDF + successor wallet address.
2. Derive AES key with PBKDF2(successorAddress, 100k iterations).
3. Encrypt file using AES-256-GCM (with random 12-byte IV).
4. Create blob: `[IV][ciphertext]`.
5. Upload encrypted blob to IPFS via API route or client-side upload.
6. Call `createInheritance(successor, ipfsHash, tag, fileName, fileSize)`.

## 2. Successor (Receiver)

1. Connect wallet.
2. Contract verifies:
   - caller == successor
   - inheritance is active & unclaimed
3. Fetch encrypted blob from IPFS.
4. Derive AES key from successor’s address (PBKDF2).
5. Decrypt and download PDF.
6. Optionally call `claimInheritance(id)` to mark as received.

---

# Security Properties (MVP)

- Files are encrypted **before upload** (E2E).
- Only successor wallet can derive the correct key.
- No keys stored on-chain, off-chain, or in IPFS.
- IPFS blobs are public but unreadable.
- On-chain lineage is tamper-proof.

Security limitations:

- If successor wallet is compromised, the encrypted file can be decrypted.
- No key rotation mechanism yet.
- Browser-based crypto requires trustworthy hosting.

# Objectives in Invisible Garden 2025

By the end of ARG25, the following core objectives were achieved:

- Record at least one _inheritance event_ (owner → successor) on-chain and show the transaction hash.
- Successfully upload an encrypted file to IPFS and store only the CID on-chain.
- Ensure that only the designated successor wallet can decrypt the encrypted file.
- Provide a clear UI workflow:  
  “inheritance created → inheritance claimable by successor → inheritance claimed → decrypted.”

# Learnings

During ARG25, we deepened our understanding of:

- Core Arbitrum Stylus concepts from the lecture series, including how Rust-based contracts interact with the Arbitrum toolchain.
- Security best practices around client-side encryption, emphasizing key derivation, storage minimization, and safe handling of encrypted payloads.
- Designing IPFS upload flows that keep the encrypted data decoupled from on-chain references while preserving traceability.
- Structuring inheritance journeys in the UI so wallet interactions, encryption steps, and status updates remain transparent to non-technical users.
- Coordinating smart contract events with frontend state to build reliable lineage timelines across deployments and testnets.
